# FootballShinyApp

Football clubs and associations realise tests in order to follow the players' evolution during the playing season and during their career. These tests deliver numeric values that can be hard to analyse in a basic table.

I created a Shiny App allowing anyone to understand, analyse and interpret the datas intuitively and almost instantly.

The datas are not available in that repo for privacy reason.
